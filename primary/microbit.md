## Key Features:&#x20;

* **Small micro-controller board designed by BBC for use in computer education in the UK**&#x20;
* **Bunch of sensors, buttons and display are packed on 4cm x 5cm board**&#x20;
* **Online programming tool and eco-system of learning material makes it ideal kit for school students**
* **Online emulator makes it convenient to learn programming even without the board**

## Hardware

* 25 individually-programmable LEDs – Create icons, display scrolling text or numbers or even graphs!
* 2 programmable buttons – Use them as input and trigger a piece of code on the device
* Physical connection pins – Connect external components like a motor, speaker or LEDs
* Light and temperature sensors – Measure physical parameters to make light and temperature dependent systems
* Motion sensors (accelerometer and compass) – Measure the acceleration, movement, shake or tilt of the Micro:bit board and use them as trigger in your code; Compass lets you detect the direction your board is facing!
* Wireless Communication, via Radio and Bluetooth – Communicate with PC, mobile or other&#x20;
* Micro:bit wirelessly USB interface – Connect to your PC and download code to it.
