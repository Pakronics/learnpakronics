#### Unlock More Possibilities with SDK

## Drone Swarm

You can program multiples Tello EDUs simultaneously through one device. Use code to control a swarm of Tello EDUs, have them fly over Mission Pads, and perform flips and other acrobatic movements. Improve your programming skills while pushing the limits of your creativity!

## Advanced Programming

Mission Pads are a fantastic asset for increased programming precision. They serve not only as guiding points, but as trigger mechanisms. Program with the specific information within each Mission Pad to expand your options and push the limits of Tello EDU. You can write code that will enable your aircraft to recognize each Missions Pad’s unique ID, as well as perform aerial acrobatics. Control a swarm of Tello EDUs, and bring your imagination to life.

## Discover More with AI

Access video stream data with Tello EDU, creating more possibilities for image processing and AI development. The new SDK 2.0 allows you to develop Tello EDU further, realizing more AI functions such as object recognition\*, tracking, 3D reconstruction through programming, computer vision, and deep learning technologies.[\* Click here to view sample code.](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Tello-Python)

## Programming Simplified

Tello EDU supports block programming. Simply drag coding blocks on the screen to program Tello EDU and enable certain movements. Additionally, the Tello Space Travel tutorial teaches you how to use the Swift programming language to code on your iPad while following a fun storyline. This space adventure is available via the Swift Playgrounds app. Team up with Tello EDU to explore the universe!
