# Grove Dust Sensor

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Dust_Sensor/master/image/Dust_sensor.JPG)

This Dust Sensor gives a good indication of the air quality in an environment by measuring the dust concentration. The Particulate Matter level \(PM level\) in the air is measured by counting the Low Pulse Occupancy time \(LPO time\) in given time unit. LPO time is proportional to PM concentration. This sensor can provide reliable data for air purifier systems; it is responsive to PM of diameter 1μm.

!!!note

* This sensor uses counting method to measure dust concentration, not weighing method, and the unit is pcs/L or pcs/0.01cf.
* Please pay attention to the warnings listed [here](grove-dust_sensor.md#jump).

## Features

* Stable and sensitive detection of not only cigarette smoke but also house dust which are indoor asthma triggers.
* Air is self-aspirated with the current of air generation mechanism with a built-in heater.
* Easy maintenance. High sensitivity lasts long term.
* Dual output for the particle size over 1 micron and 2.5 micron \(approx\).
* More compact and lighter, and easy installation.

  !!!note

  In the latest version, output Hi Voltage is changed from 4.0V to 4.5V.

!!!Tip More details about Grove modules please refer to [Grove System](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove_System/)

### Connection

Here is a demo to show how to obtain PM concentration data from this Grove - Dust Sensor.

Plug the dust sensor into digital port **D8** on the Grove - [Base Shield](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Base_Shield). It can only be D8 because the operation of this sensor involves sampling. This function only can be achieved by D8, the input capturing pin of ATmega328P, on Arduino/Seeeduino.

| Arduino UNO | Dust Sensor Pin | Cable Color |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5V | Pin 3 | Red wire |
| GND | Pin 1 | Black wire |
| D8 | Pin 4 | Yellow wire |

Grove cable is included in Grove Dust Sensor package. We also can use Dupont Line to connect Base Shield as below picture. ![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Dust_Sensor/raw/master/image/connection.jpg)

Also, you can connect Grove - Dust sensor to Arduino UNO without Base Shield.

### Software

Copy and paste the demo code below to a new Arduino sketch.

int pin = 8;
unsigned long duration;
unsigned long starttime;
unsigned long sampletime_ms = 2000;//sampe 30s&nbsp;;
unsigned long lowpulseoccupancy = 0;
float ratio = 0;
float concentration = 0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(8,INPUT);
  starttime = millis();//get the current time;
}

void loop() {
  duration = pulseIn(pin, LOW);
  lowpulseoccupancy = lowpulseoccupancy+duration;

  if ((millis()-starttime) >= sampletime_ms)//if the sampel time = = 30s
  {
    ratio = lowpulseoccupancy/(sampletime_ms*10.0);  // Integer percentage 0=&gt;100
    concentration = 1.1*pow(ratio,3)-3.8*pow(ratio,2)+520*ratio+0.62; // using spec sheet curve
    Serial.print("concentration = ");
    Serial.print(concentration);
    Serial.println(" pcs/0.01cf");
    Serial.println("\n");
    lowpulseoccupancy = 0;
    starttime = millis();
  }
}
```

In this program, the Seeeduino samples the total duration of "logic low" in 30s, and this duration illustrates the dust density of environment. Open Serial Monitor, we can get air quality's value detected by sensor from PC's serial port.

**"lowpulseoccupancy"** represents the Low Pulse Occupancy Time\(LPO Time\) detected in given 30s. Its unit is microseconds.

**"ratio"** reflects on which level LPO Time takes up the whole sample time.

**"concentration"** is a figure that has a physical meaning. It is calculated from the characteristic graph below by using the LPO time. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Dust_Sensor/master/image/600px-Characteristics.jpg)

Here is a graph of the dust concentration measured in office :

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Dust_Sensor/master/image/600px-Dust_sensor_4.jpg)

We can see the concentration of dust is very low in the evening, but it is higher in the afternoon. A threshold can be set when the concentration is above a value. Also, if you want to set the sensor more sensitive you can add a fan on the sensor, and add a 10kΩ resistor between the Pin5 and Ground.

This section an IoT demo made by Seeeduino and [Grove](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_System).

More attention is being paid to the environmental air quality nowadays because the tiny particles in the air around can badly endanger people’s health. We always get the information of environment from our government department. But it’s the average value of the whole city/section. It can not reflect the environment around you accurately.
