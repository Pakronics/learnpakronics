# Grove Barometer Sensor BME280

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Barometer_Sensor-BME280/master/img/Grove-Barometer_Sensor-BMP280-700_s.jpg)

Grove - Barometer Sensor \(BME280\) is a breakout board for Bosch BMP280 high-precision, low-power combined humidity, pressure, and temperature sensor. This module can be used to measure temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity accurately and fast. As the atmospheric pressure changes with altitude, it can also measure approximate **altitude** of a place. It can be connected to a microcontroller with I2C \(integrated with Grove socket\) or through SPI bus. We have also provided highly abstracted library to make this more product easier to use.

The BME280 is an upgraded version of BMP180, and BME280 gets dramatic improvements from BMP180. BME280 comes with a smaller footprint, lower power consumption, lower noise measurements, higher resolutions for pressure and temperature, lower RMS noise, newly added SPI bus, more measuring modes, higher measuring rate, and newly added filter against environmental interference. Since the atmosphere pressure reading is affected by altitude and temperature, we have added compensation features. Hence, Grove - Barometer Sensor \(BME280\) will be more reliable in providing precise temperature, atmospheric pressure values, humidity and approximate altitude data.

Using the sensor is easy. For [Seeeduino](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Seeeduino-V42-p-2517.html?cPath=6_7) \(compliant with Arduino\), just connect this breakout board using [Grove cable](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Universal-4-Pin-Buckled-5cm-Cable-5-PCs-Pack-p-925.html?cPath=98_106_57) to I2C Grove connector. Then, use the provided library and example code from GitHub. If you are using an Arduino either use Base Shield v2.0 or simply connect the VCC pin to the 5V voltage pin, GND to ground, SCL to I2C Clock \(Analog 5\) and SDA to I2C Data \(Analog 4\).

Typical applications: Enhancement of GPS navigation, outdoor/indoor navigation, weather forecast, or any other project that requires accurate atmospheric pressure reading.

### Platforms Supported

Note

1. The above list is only for battery.
2. If no version number is mentioned for a specific platform, it means this product supports all versions within this platform.

## Hardware Overview

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Barometer_Sensor-BME280/master/img/Grove-Barometer_Sensor-BME280-Components_1200_s.jpg)

* **SPI soldering pads**, a voltage monitoring circuit.
* **Interface bus selection pads** , to select I2C bus, connect the two pads by soldering \(it is connected by default\); to select SPI bus, cut the two pads with a sharp knife or a soldering iron.
* **Slave board address selection pads**, to select slave board address to avoid address collision.
  * If you have selected I2C bus, the default address for slave board is **0x76** \(right-two pads are connected\). If you want to use the address **0x77**, connect only the left two \(disconnect right two\) by soldering.

    Tip You can disconnect pads with just a sharp knife.

  * If you have selected SPI bus, the default address for slave board is **0x76** \(right-two pads are connected\). If you want to use the address **0x77**, disconnect all three pads.

Note Do not touch or shake or let this product in vibration when it works. This will cause interference and will affect the accuracy of data collected.
