# Grove Vibration Motor

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Vibration_Motor/master/img/Gvib.jpg)

This is a mini vibration motor suitable as a non-audible indicator. When the input is HIGH, the motor will vibrate just like your cell phone on silent mode.

### Platforms Supported

### Usage

#### With [Arduino](/Arduino)

To make it vibrate is just as easy as to turn on an LED. Here is an example showing how to turn on the vibration motor.

1. Plug it onto the Digital port 9 of Grove - Base Shield using a Grove cable.
2. Plug the Grove - Base Shield onto Arduino.

3. Connect Arduino to PC by using a USB cable.
4. Copy and paste code below to a new Arduino sketch, and upload it to your Arduino. 

Use the demo code shown below:

```text
int MoPin = 9;    // vibrator Grove connected to digital pin 9

void setup()  {
    pinMode( MoPin, OUTPUT );
}

void loop()  {

    digitalWrite(MoPin, HIGH);
    delay(1000);

    digitalWrite(MoPin, LOW);
    delay(1000);
}
```

Now, feel the vibration of your motor!

#### With Raspberry Pi

1.You should have a Raspberry Pi and a grovepi or grovepi+.

2.You should have completed configuring the development enviroment, otherwise follow [here](/GrovePiPlus).

3.Connection

* Plug the sensor to grovepi socket D8 by using a grove cable.

4.Navigate to the demos' directory:

```text
cd yourpath/GrovePi/Software/Python/
```

* To see the code

  ```text
  nano grove_vibration_motor.py   # "Ctrl+x" to exit #
  ```

  \`\`\`

  import time

  import grovepi

## Connect the Grove Vibration Motor to digital port D8

## SIG,NC,VCC,GND

vibration\_motor = 8

grovepi.pinMode\(vibration\_motor,"OUTPUT"\)

while True: try:

```text
    # Start vibrating for 1 second
    grovepi.digitalWrite(vibration_motor,1)
    print 'start'
    time.sleep(1)

    # Stop vibrating for 1 second, then repeat
    grovepi.digitalWrite(vibration_motor,0)
    print 'stop'
    time.sleep(1)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    grovepi.digitalWrite(vibration_motor,0)
    break
except IOError:
    print "Error"
```

```text
5.Run the demo.
```

sudo python grove\_vibration\_motor.py

\`\`\`

### Project

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Lotus/master/img/gun.jpg)

Inspired by OVERWATCH, we have made a very cool Wooden Laser Gun toy for fun these day!

The Wooden Laser Gun and the Gun Target are all based on an Arduino board called Seeeduino Lotus. The laser emitter on the Laser Gun is controlled to fire laser pulse to "activate" the Gun Target. And there are 3 light sensors on the Gun Target to detect the laser pulse. It seems very simple right? If you are interested in our project, please make one for yourself or your child! It's worth to spend one day DIY it as a Xmas present.
