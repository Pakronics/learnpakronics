# Grove MP3 v2.0

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-MP3_v2.0/master/img/Grove-MP3_v2.0_Product_View_700_S.jpg)

Grove - MP3 v2.0 is a tiny-sized and compact audio module. It supports various audio file operations for an audio file of MP3, WAV and WMV format, such as random music playing, play music in specific files, and so on. With serial communication, you can use all predefined command or command combinations to do all operations on music files. This module also supports general file systems such as FAT16 and FAT32. It gets a Grove UART interface, a 3.5 mm audio jack and a micro-SD slot. With this module, you can add some noise to your silent applications.

## Get started

### **Material required**

* Seeeduino × 1
* Grove - Base Shield v2 × 1
* Grove - MP3 v2.0 × 1
* SD card with music inside × 1
* USB cable \(type A to micro type-B\) × 1
* Headset, earphone or stereo with 3.5 mm audio jack × 1

### Preparations

Refer to following guides to building an appropriate IDE:.

Note We have chosen Seeeduino and it is compatible with Arduino in this case. So you can also use Arduino board instead.

### A example to run

#### Download example

1.Github [address](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_Serial_MP3_Player_V2.0) which also contain sufficient API to download codes.

2.Refer to \[here\]\(/Guide\_to\_use\_demos\_downloaded\_from\_Seeed's\_Github\) to learn how to do some preliminary work before running code.

3.Load file _MP3\_Play\_Test.ino_ into Arduino and upload to the main controller board.

4.Open Serial Monitor \(Ctrl + Shift + M\) to send a command to play music.

Note We need to choose No line ending beside baud rate droplist at bottom-right of Serial Monitor window.

5.In this case, we type _1_ which is a command to play music. You can find more command comments in demo source code.

6.Now enjoy the music.

### Advanced programming
