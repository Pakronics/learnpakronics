# Grove Circular LED

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Circular\_LED/raw/master/img/Circular\_LED.jpg) This is a unique ringâ€“ it has a florid body with 24 controllable LEDs. Maybe it will drive the inspiration out of you to make a glowing magic ring! There is a 1\*1 square hollow-out in the middle of this module, where you can place a Grove Encoder in and make it a rotary visual encoder!

## Features

* Circular shape
* 24 LEDs, about 5.5 mA drive current for each channel.
* Controllable LEDs with florid effects
* Grove Interface.
