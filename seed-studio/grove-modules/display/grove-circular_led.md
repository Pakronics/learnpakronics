# Grove-Circular\_LED

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Circular_LED/raw/master/img/Circular_LED.jpg) This is a unique ring– it has a florid body with 24 controllable LEDs. Maybe it will drive the inspiration out of you to make a glowing magic ring! There is a 1\*1 square hollow-out in the middle of this module, where you can place a Grove Encoder in and make it a rotary visual encoder!
