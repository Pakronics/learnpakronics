# Grove OR

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-OR/raw/master/img/Mixer\_v2.0\_OR.jpg)

This module provides the function of a [logical OR gate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OR\_gate). It is base on the 74HC1G32GW chip. The 74HC1G32GW is a high-speed Si-gate CMOS device that provides a 2-input OR function. The Grove - OR module therefore has two inputs on the left and one output on the right. The output of this logical OR gate module is HIGH when it gets a HIGH signal on any of the two inputs.
