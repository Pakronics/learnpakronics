**Grove Touch Sensor**

This "button" can sense the touch of your fingers.

**Grove Sound Sensor**

This is a sensor to evaluate the intensity of sound.

**Grove - Light Sensor v1.2**

This is a sensor that detects the light level in daily occasions

**Grove Servo**

This is an actuator whose position can be precisely controlled.

**Grove Dust Sensor**

This sensor can measure air quality.

**Grove Temperature & Humidity Sensor Pro**

It has more complete and accurate performance than the basic version. The detecting range of this sensor is 5% RH - 99% RH, and -40°C - 80°C.

**Grove UV Sensor**

This sensor is used for detecting the intensity of incident ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

**Grove - Barometer Sensor (BMP280)**

This sensor can is used for detecting the atmospheric pressure and temperature.

**Grove 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer (±16g)**

This is a high resolution digital accelerometer providing you at max 3.9mg/LSB resolution and large ±16g measurement range.

**Grove Led Bar**

Grove LED Bar is comprised of a 10 segment LED, you can use it as an indicator.

**Grove Base Shield**

Base Shield is an interface between Arduino and Grove modules. There are 16 Grove sockets on the base shield, whichcan be divided into three deferent functional areas: digital ports (8), analog ports (4), and I2C ports (4).
