# Grove AND

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-AND/raw/master/img/AND_photo1.jpg)

This module provides the function of a [logical AND gate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate). It is based on the 74HC1G08 chip, which is a high-speed Si-gate CMOS device that provides a 2-input AND function. The Grove - AND module therefore has two inputs on the left and one output on the right. The output is HIGH only when all the input signals are HIGH.

## Features

* Simple AND gate function with two inputs and a single output
* Makes integrating a Logical AND gate in your circuit a breeze
* Uses Standard 4-pin [Grove Cables](/GROVE_System#Grove_Cables) to connect to other [Grove](/Grove) modules

## Usage

* See [Grove - AND module typical usage](/GROVE_MIXER_PACK_V2#Grove-AND_module)
