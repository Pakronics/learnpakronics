# Grove AND

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-AND/raw/master/img/AND\_photo1.jpg)

This module provides the function of a [logical AND gate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND\_gate). It is based on the 74HC1G08 chip, which is a high-speed Si-gate CMOS device that provides a 2-input AND function. The Grove - AND module therefore has two inputs on the left and one output on the right. The output is HIGH only when all the input signals are HIGH.
