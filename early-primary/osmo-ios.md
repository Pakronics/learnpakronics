### Transforming how children learn

Osmo merges tactile exploration with innovative technology, actively engaging children in the learning process.

### How Osmo works



1. Put your device in a compatible Osmo Base with the red reflector over the device’s camera.
2. Play with physical game pieces — draw, code, spell, and more.
3. Osmo scans the table and your child’s creations come alive on the screen!
