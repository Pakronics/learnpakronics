Helps kids learn how to code by playing with a **screenless**, **words free** educational coding game. Kids will program a robot, creating music, art and many more through this kit!

We know kids naturally play and learn by using their hands, eyes, and ears. This is essential for cognitive development, so we have created a solution for kids to start coding from a young age.

Kids use their imagination to create infinite possibilities using coding blocks, by controlling a robot car through coding algorithms. Kids receive instant feedback, and quickly learn that coding is simple. Starting young and equipped with an understanding of fundamental concepts, kids at a later age will be able to grasp more abstract concepts of real programming at school and can learn without fear.

## **Get to Know**

**MatataBot**

MatataBot is a robot car that enhances the thrill of adventure, its unique attachments allow it to draw and sing too! It helps kids learn about STEAM, \(Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics\) and develop problem-solving skills.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_1440,w_720,f_auto,q_auto/v1/1216473/%E7%94%BB%E6%9D%BF_4_bqbjzh.png)

**Command Tower**

With image recognition, it tells the MatataBot where to go!  
Kids can also put their favorite Lego® Minifigures in the command room.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_1440,w_720,f_auto,q_auto/v1/1216473/%E7%94%BB%E6%9D%BF_2_mperyc.png)

**Control Board**

Place the blocks on the board to conquer stages together with MatataBot. Hit the button, and the MatataBot executes your program.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_1440,w_720,f_auto,q_auto/v1/1216473/blocks_xggrid.png)

**Coding Blocks**

Tangible coding blocks make coding touchable and playable, helping kids concentrate, through enjoyment. Coding becomes a hands-on experience — literally!![](https://res.cloudinary.com/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_1440,w_720,f_auto,q_auto/v1/1216473/%E7%94%BB%E6%9D%BF_3_wgnrl9.png)
