**Step Two: Program HaloCode**

**Connect to the Internet**

1. Under "Devices", make sure "HaloCode" is selected. Drag an Events block when HaloCode starts up to the Scripts area. Add a Wi-Fi block connect to Wi-Fi \(\) password \(\). Input Wi-Fi SSID \(Wi-Fi name\) and password.

2. To ensure Wi-Fi is successfully connected, we need to add a Control block wait \(\) and a Wi-Fi block Wi-Fi is connected?. We want to know when Wi-Fi is connected, so let's add a Lighting block all LEDs light up \(\) to make the LED ring lights up green.

**Cloud Message Script**

When HaloCode receives the user cloud message "light\_on", we want the LED ring to light up red and then go off.

1. Drag a Wi-Fi block when receiving user cloud message \(\) and input "light\_on". Add a Lighting block all LEDs light up \(\) and set the color to red.
