* [Obstacle avoidance](http://docs.makeblock.com/mbot/en/tutorials/preset-modes.html#obstacle-avoidance-mode)
* [Infrared remote control](http://docs.makeblock.com/mbot/en/tutorials/preset-modes.html#infrared-remote-control-mode)
* [line-following](http://docs.makeblock.com/mbot/en/tutorials/preset-modes.html#line-following-mode)

Switch modes using the **infrared remote controller or the on-board button**.

**Infrared remote control mode**

A special infrared remote controller is included in the package. You can use the controller to control mBot, such as speed, direction, and others.
