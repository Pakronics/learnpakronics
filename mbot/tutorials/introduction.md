# introduction

As Makeblock's award-winning programming robot, mBot has taken the heart of over 4,500,000 children around the world. Not only do children adore mBot's loving appearance, but they also love playing with it.

With a screwdriver and step-by-step instructions, children can build their own robot from scratch and enjoy the fun of hands-on creation. The building process provides a perfect opportunity to introduce kids to the basics of robotic machinery and electronic parts. They can easily get started with block-based programming to play with mBot.
