**6. \(\) &gt; \(\)**

If the value of the specified parameter is greater than the specified value, the report condition is met.

**Example:**

When the green flag is clicked, if the light intensity is greater than 50, all LEDs will light up red.

**7. \(\) &lt; \(\)**

If the value of the specified parameter is less than the specified value, the report condition is met.

**Example:**

When the green flag is clicked, if the light intensity is smaller than 50, all LEDs will light up red.

**8. \(\) = \(\)**

If the value of the specified parameter equals the specified value, the report condition is met.

**Example:**

When the greed flag is clicked, if the distance of obstacle detected by the ultrasonic sensor equals 50 cm, all LEDs will light up red.

**9. \(\) and \(\)**

If both the conditions are met, the report condition is met.

**Example:**

When the greed flag is clicked, if the on-board button is released, and button A of the IR remote is pressed, all LEDs will light up red.

**10. \(\) or \(\)**

If either one of the two conditions is met, the report condition is met.

**Example:**

When the greed flag is clicked, if either the on-board button is pressed, or button A of the IR remote is pressed, all LEDs will light up red.

**11. not \(\)**

The report condition is met when the specified condition is not met.

**Example:**

When the greed flag is clicked, if the on-board button is not pressed, all LEDs will light up red.

**12. join \(\) \(\)**

Join two specified character strings.

**Example:**

When the space key is pressed, the external LED panel will display "hi" and "morning" together.
